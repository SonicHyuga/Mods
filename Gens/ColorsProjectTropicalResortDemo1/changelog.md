## Tropical Resort Demo 1 - v0.2.1
- Fixed emissive material shaders. Resolves the issue of Sonic's shadow not appearing on these specific surfaces, and also fixes mismatched lighting on the materials.
- The distant light effect material was set to double-sided, which could be seen in some areas where it should not.
- Add option to select between Sonic Colors or Sonic Colors Ultimate soundtracks. Special thanks to Mario Tainaka. Configure using HedgeModManager.
